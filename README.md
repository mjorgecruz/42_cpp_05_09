  - Custom exception classes.
  - Proper resource management with exceptions.

**Project Focus:**

- Implement robust exception handling and custom exceptions to handle errors gracefully.

### Module 06

**Objective:** Understand casting mechanisms, including static, dynamic, reinterpret, and const casts, emphasizing their safe and correct use.

- **Key Concepts:**
  - Static vs. dynamic casting.
  - Reinterpret cast and potential risks.
  - Const correctness and const casting.
  - Safe downcasting using dynamic\_cast.

**Project Focus:**

- Demonstrate various casting scenarios within an inheritance hierarchy.
